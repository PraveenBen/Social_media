# Social_media_Networking

A PHP project developed in my Degree College

It is used to chat with friends and post quotes, text, and photos with friends.

It was a very simple project I am uploading it to maintain my history

To run this use Apache XAMPP

Download and save the folder in HTDocs and run XAMPP server

Note: Add Database to MySQL server use PHPMyadmin
